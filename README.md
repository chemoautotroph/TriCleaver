# TriCleaver

TriCleaver is a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm that designs switchable ribozymes (SRzs) that selectively the mutant transcript of an associated trinucleotide repeat disorder (TRD).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Numpy
- Windows OS

## Setup

- Clone this repository.
- Place the four folding binaries (**RNAfold.exe**, **RNAcofold.exe**, **RNAfold300.exe**, **RNAcofold300.exe**) in the same directory as the main script (tri_cleaver.py). These binaries were generated by compiling the ViennaRNA package with the **MAXLOOP** parameter changed from 30 to 300, which is necessary for correct structure prediction of larger selective ribozymes. Note that slight changes have been made to these binaries to print out the base-pairing probability matrix to the console instead of generating .ps files.
- (Optional) To use the ViennaRNA Python bindings instead of the provided folding binaries, modify the vienna.py script to interface with the bindings.

## Usage

- Create a .txt containing the sequence of the wild-type strand associated with the target TRD. Place a dash (-) on each side the repeats region.
- Create a .txt containing the sequence of the mutant strand associated with the target TRD. Place a dash (-) on each side the repeats region.
- The region upstream of the repeats must be the same in both the wild-type and mutant sequence. 
- The region downstream of the repeats must be the same in both the wild-type and mutant sequence. 
- The number of mutant repeats must be greater than the number of wild-type repeats.
- Run the script with the following command:

`python tri_cleaver.py --wt_file=[WILD_TYPE_FILE_NAME.txt] --mutant_file=[MUTANT_FILE_NAME.txt]`

For example

`python tri_cleaver.py --wt_file=PABPN1_WT.txt --mutant_file=PABPN1_Mutant.txt`

TriCleaver will generate a diverse population of SRzs that cleave the mutant strand of the target TRD, but not the wild-type. The designs are stored in a CSV file named **SRz_designs.csv**. Each row in the file corresponds to a designed SRz and contains the sequence of the SRz.

## Additional notes
- SRz design is computationally intensive; it will take several hours on a multi-core machine.
- This code has been tested on a Windows 10 machine running Python 3.7.9.
- Installation should only take a few minutes.
